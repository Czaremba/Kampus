This is my project for startup weekend york region. It transcribes long(hours) speech recordings into text. From that point it can summarize that text or translate it into another Language.

This repository is only some parts of the project I worked on, as the full project is closed source(for commercial purposes, I'm selling the project with a few friends)

Scripts
Translator.py
    This is the script I authored that utilizes the google translate api to translate the transcript into traditional chinese text.
  
Kommas.py
  This is a script that adds random punctuation to text to get the summarizer to work properly(the summarizer algorithm requires punctuation and the transcribed text is punctuationless)
  
AI_Summarizer.py
  This is the script that calls the text summarizer API from Algorithmia Servers
